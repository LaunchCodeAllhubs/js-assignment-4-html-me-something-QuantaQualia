            <h2>A Brief Word on the Latin Liturgy</h2>
            <p>"Hello, reader!  Before we begin our short venture into the world of Latin liturgical music and its general characteristics,
               it is important to have a little context, so that we may better understand them as we encounter them.  The standard musical repertory of 
               Latin Christianity is known as Gregorian chant, which is a monophonic plainsong style that developed over the course of roughly 15 centuries in 
               Western Europe, and has its roots in Roman Latin and Byzantine Greek plainsong forms that underwent various organic evolutions, transformations, 
               hybridizations, and standardizations throughout that time.  

               Gregorian chant derives its name from the various codifications of the Roman Rite (the primary form of Christian worship in Western Europe) 
               that occurred during the pontificates of both Gregory I (+604 AD) and Gregory II (+731 AD), which included various changes and contributions 
               of their predecessors and their successors.  It would be too lengthy of an explanation to go into all the specifics, but suffice it to say 
               that the name "Gregorian" came to be used later in history to describe this particular form of plainsong in the West as an homage to their memory.  
               The liturgy itself is in fact a hybrid of what is now called "Old Roman" chant and the Gallican, or Frankish chant that was already in use in the Frankish, 
               Gothic, Celtic, and other regions north of the Alps prior to the Carolingian era.  The generally agreed upon origin of Gregorian chant is thus found in 
               the time of Charlemagne who, wishing to have greater unity within his realm, sought to conform its form of Christian worship with that of the 
               old and venerable city of Rome.  Thus, he abolished the old Gallican Rite that had been in use among the Franks and others in his realm, and replaced 
               it with the Roman Rite.  This, of course, included its music, as well as its rites, ceremonies, and selections of texts.

               However, the old Gallican music, as well as many of its local customs, did not cease entirely, but were instead incorporated organically into the "new" Roman 
               form.  There was a period of several centuries from that time in which a fascinating exchange of books, letters, and musical manuscripts travelled 
               back and forth across the Alps, that ultimately came to influence and shape even local Roman tradition, such that by the time we arrive at the end of the 
               Middle Ages, there is no significant difference between the two in terms of music and text, as they had influenced each other so much.  This historical process 
               resulted in what we now know as Gregorian chant.

               It should be noted that there are even today two other types of ancient Latin liturgical repertories that are not, properly speaking, Roman.  The Ambrosian Rite 
               in the city of Milan and its surrounding region of Northern Italy, and the Mozarabic Rite of the city of Toledo and Northern Spain both hold claim to this 
               distinction.  But they are outside the scope of this discussion, so we will have to leave them unexplored, and begin our tour of the Roman liturgical repertory."

            <h2>The Types of Liturgical Pieces</h2>
            <p>
               "The categories of musical pieces found in the Roman Rite have been variously described by scholars over the years, but for our purposes we can look at them as being 
               of three basic types:  recitative, free-form, and rhythmic (or metrical).  
               
               (1) Recitative chants include psalms tones and reading tones.  These two types of recitation formulae form the skeletal structure of the Gregorian repertory,
               and it is from these that everything else is built, as these are the simplest and most basic of chants.  The purpose of these formalaic types is to provide a highly flexible
               method of cantillating texts for which no pre-composed melody is being applied, such as psalm verses, Bible readings, and prayers.  Thus, any text that could be read, could also be 
               sung using these simple tones.

               (2) Free-form chants include the various antiphons, graduals, Alleluia, and responsories of both the Mass and the Divine Office (the hours of prayer).  Antiphons are normally 
               sung with psalm verses attached to them, which are themselves sung with psalm tones matching the musical mode of the antiphon.  Antiphons are the simplest of the free-form chants.  
               The gradual and Alleluia are sung at Mass between the first and second readings and are self-contained chants.  The responsories are similar to the gradual and Alleluia, but 
               display greater variety in their characteristics, and are sung in the Divine Office, rather than in the Mass.  The graduals, Alleluia, and responsories are undoubtedly the most
               rich and complex of this type.
               
               (3) Rhythmic chants include hymns and sequences, and a few other types of pieces.  For this, we will focus only on hymns and sequences.  A hymn is
               a metrical poem arranged with a single repeating melody, and it normally follows an established pattern of "ABCD" in its textual and melodic structure.  Each verse is sung with 
               the same melody in this "ABCD" pattern, and concludes with "Amen" after the last verse.  Most people are already familiar with this form, as it is the normal pattern of church hymns 
               even outside of Gregorian chant.  Sequences are a bit different, as they are not strophic, as in repeating a pattern with every verse, but rather, they have a more complex structure 
               with greater variation in the meter of the poetry and music."

            <h2>Psalm Tone</h2>
            <p>
               "Psalm tones are organized into different modes, each mode representing a basic musical scale that is used for singing. The psalm tone itself has a beginning, middle, and ending form, 
               which is repeated for each verse."

               "Reading tones are similar to psalm tones, in that they follow a repetition pattern, but there are differences in the way that the verses are parsed."

               "Antiphons are simple free-form chants that are used in both the Mass and Divine Office, almost always accompanied by verses taken from a psalm or other biblical text."

            <p>
               "Responsories are found in the Divine Office, which is the cycle of services outside of the Mass, such as Vespers and Compline in the evening, and Matins in the morning.  
               A responsory is, as the name implies, a response, usually to a reading of some sort.  The majority of these are sung during the service of Matins, which includes a collection of readings of
               various types, together with psalms and other chants.  The structure of a responsory is such that first part of the responsory is sung, followed by a verse, and then the verse
               concludes with the second half of the first part, forming a call and response type of structure."

            <p>
               "Hymns are used primarily in the Divine Office, but also find use at Mass and during processions as a musical interlude transitioning from one thing or place to another.  They are 
               designed to be easily sung and also easily remembered by those who sing them regularly."

            <p>
               "Sequences are a unique type of hymn that are sung only on special occasions today in the Roman Rite, but in the Middle Ages were very common to hear at Mass.  Nowadays, you will 
               probably only find a sequence sung at Easter or some other solemnity.  A sequence is always sung between the Alleluia and the reading of the Gospel at Mass."
